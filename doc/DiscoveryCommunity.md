# Discovery Community

`DiscoveryCommunity` implements the peer discovery mechanism. It tries to keep an active connection with a specified number of peers (30 by default) and keeps track of communities they participate in. It performs regular keep-alive checks and drops inactive peers. While it is possible to run IPv8 without using this community, it is not recommended.
